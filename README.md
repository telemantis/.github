# Telemantis

Telemantis is an intelligent system for pest detection and quality validation in citrus production.  
By combining artificial intelligence, computer vision, and efficient infrastructure, the project aims to reduce costs, optimize processing time, and enhance the overall quality of citrus yield.

## Project Goals
- Develop AI models for real-time pest detection and fruit quality analysis.  
- Provide a scalable infrastructure that supports both cloud and local deployments.  
- Deliver an accessible web application for growers and producers to interact with the system.  
- Validate the system in real production environments to measure efficiency and ROI.

## Main Components
- **Infrastructure** ‚Äì Data storage, synchronization, and availability services.  
- **Web Application** ‚Äì User interface for visualization, reporting, and system management.  
- **AI & Computer Vision** ‚Äì Detection models for pests and fruit quality.  

Each component is developed and maintained in its own repository within the organization.

## Vision
Our vision is to transform citrus production through intelligent technology. Telemantis aims to provide growers with real-time insights into pest presence and fruit quality, reducing losses and improving efficiency across the supply chain. By combining artificial intelligence, computer vision, and scalable infrastructure, we seek to make advanced agricultural tools accessible, reliable, and actionable, ultimately helping producers deliver higher-quality fruit while optimizing costs and sustainability.

## About Us
Telemantis is developed by three Telematics Engineering students as part of our final degree project.  
Our team covers infrastructure, AI and computer vision, and web development to bring the system to life.
